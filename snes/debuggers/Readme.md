## Snes Debuggers

In this folder we need to add all the emulators used for Snes projects.

You need to download the last releases from the following repositories:

[https://github.com/Dgdiniz/bsnes-plus](https://github.com/Dgdiniz/bsnes-plus)
[https://github.com/Dgdiniz/bsnes-v086-source](https://github.com/Dgdiniz/bsnes-v086-source)

After the download, extract the folders to have the following folders:

- bsnes-plus
- bsnes_v086-source
- bsnes_v086-64bit

The build scripts will look for these folders, so make sure you have the right structure.
